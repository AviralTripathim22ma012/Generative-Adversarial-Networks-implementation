# 👁️‍🗨️ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Project 🎨

## Welcome to the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Project! 🚀

### Overview ℹ️
This project focuses on implementing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a special emphasis on the Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture. GANs are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, capable of generating new data samples similar to a given training dataset.

### Key Features 🔑
- Implementation of basic GAN architecture and training procedure.
- Integration of the DCGAN architecture for generating high-quality images.
- Training the GAN on a dataset of images to generate new, realistic-looking images.
- Visualization of generated images and comparison with real images.

### Getting Started 🎬
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the codebase to understand the implementation of GANs and DCGAN.
4. Run the provided scripts or notebooks to train the GAN and generate new images.

### Usage 💡
- Train the GAN on your own dataset of images to generate new, synthetic images.
- Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve image quality.
- Explore the latent space and generate images by sampling from different parts of the latent space.
